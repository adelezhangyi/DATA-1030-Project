# **Predicting Customer Responses to Marketing Campaigns**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to predict customer responses to marketing campaigns based on demographics, product types, and sentiment analysis. By leveraging **Python** and data science libraries, we analyze customer behavior, process raw data, build predictive models, and generate insights into **ad click likelihood**.

The code is developed with a focus on reproducibility so that anyone can run the project locally.
